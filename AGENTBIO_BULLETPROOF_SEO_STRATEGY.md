## III. GEO (GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION) STRATEGY

### What is GEO?

Generative Engine Optimization ensures AgentBio content appears in:
- ChatGPT responses
- Claude conversations
- Perplexity.ai results
- Google AI Overviews
- Microsoft Copilot
- Gemini (Google AI)

### GEO Implementation Tactics

#### A. Content Structuring for AI Extraction

**1. Direct Answer Format (First 100 Words)**

Every major page should answer the core query in the first paragraph:

**Example (Homepage):**
```
AgentBio is a specialized link-in-bio platform designed specifically for 
real estate agents who want to convert Instagram followers into qualified 
buyer and seller leads. Unlike generic tools like Linktree, AgentBio includes 
property listing galleries, lead capture forms, calendar booking integration, 
and testimonial showcases—all optimized for mobile users coming from Instagram 
and other social platforms. Real estate agents use AgentBio to consolidate 
their portfolio, contact info, and lead generation tools into one shareable 
link that turns social media traffic into actual business.
```

**Why This Works:**
- AI tools extract and cite this paragraph
- Contains primary keywords naturally
- Answers "What is AgentBio?" directly
- Includes differentiators vs competitors

**2. Semantic HTML & Content Chunking**

AI systems parse content in "chunks" (passages), not full pages. Structure with clear semantic HTML:

```html
<article>
  <section>
    <h2>What makes AgentBio different from Linktree?</h2>
    <p><strong>Direct Answer:</strong> AgentBio includes property listing 
    galleries, lead capture forms, calendar booking, and testimonials—features 
    generic link-in-bio tools don't offer. It's purpose-built for real estate 
    professionals.</p>
    <p>[Supporting details...]</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>How do real estate agents use link-in-bio tools?</h2>
    <p><strong>Direct Answer:</strong> Real estate agents place their link-in-bio 
    URL in their Instagram profile to showcase property listings, capture lead 
    inquiries, and book appointments with buyers and sellers.</p>
    <p>[Supporting details...]</p>
  </section>
</article>
```

**Key Elements:**
- Use `<section>` tags for distinct topics
- Start each section with a question-based `<h2>`
- Provide direct answer immediately
- Use `<strong>` or bolding for key phrases
- Keep paragraphs under 100 words

**3. Question-Based Subsections**

AI tools prioritize content that directly answers questions. Structure pages around common queries:

**Example Subsections:**
- What is a link in bio for real estate agents?
- Why do agents need a specialized link-in-bio tool?
- How much does AgentBio cost?
- Can I showcase property listings on my bio page?
- What lead capture forms does AgentBio include?
- How do I connect my calendar for bookings?

**4. Data & Statistics (Cite Sources)**

AI prefers citing authoritative content with data:

```
According to the National Association of Realtors, 43% of home buyers 
find their agent through referrals or online sources, making a strong 
Instagram presence critical for lead generation. Real estate agents who 
use optimized link-in-bio tools report 8-12 qualified lead inquiries per 
month from social media traffic (AgentBio internal data, 2025).
```

**Sources to cite:**
- NAR (National Association of Realtors)
- Zillow research
- Inman News reports
- HubSpot marketing studies
- Internal AgentBio user data

**5. Comparison Tables**

AI tools love structured data in tables:

```markdown
| Feature                  | AgentBio | Linktree | Beacons |
|--------------------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Property Listings        | ✅ Yes   | ❌ No    | ❌ No   |
| Lead Capture Forms       | ✅ Yes   | ⚠️ Basic | ⚠️ Basic|

| Price (monthly)          | $39      | $24      | $10     |
```

#### C. FAQ Schema Markup (Critical for AI)

Every major page needs FAQ schema:

```json
{

  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is AgentBio?",

  ]
}
```

**Deploy FAQ Schema On:**
- Homepage

galleries with photos and pricing, lead capture forms for buyer inquiries 
and home valuations, calendar booking integration with Calendly and Google 
Calendar, and testimonial displays that build credibility—all optimized 
for mobile users coming from Instagram bios.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Self-contained answer
- Keyword-rich without stuffing
- Specific features mentioned
- Context for "why" clear

#### E. Natural Language & Conversational Tone

AI models prefer natural, conversational content:

**Before:**
"AgentBio platform enables property showcase functionality for agent users."

**After:**
"Real estate agents can showcase their active property listings on AgentBio, 
complete with photo galleries, pricing, square footage, and MLS numbers."

**Tips:**
- Write like you're explaining to a colleague
- Use "you" and "your" frequently
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Define acronyms on first use (MLS = Multiple Listing Service)
- Use transitions between sections

#### F. LLMS.txt File (Optional But Recommended)

Create `/llms.txt` file for AI crawlers:

## IV. AEO (ANSWER ENGINE OPTIMIZATION) STRATEGY

### What is AEO?

Answer Engine Optimization targets featured snippets, Google AI Overviews, and "People Also Ask" boxes—zero-click results where users get answers without visiting your site.

### AEO Implementation Tactics

#### A. Featured Snippet Optimization

**Paragraph Snippets (40-60 words):**

Target questions with concise definitions:

**Q: What is a link in bio for real estate agents?**
**A:** "A link in bio for real estate agents is a landing page placed in an Instagram profile that showcases property listings, captures lead inquiries, and books appointments. Unlike generic link-in-bio tools, real estate-specific platforms like AgentBio include features tailored to agent workflows: listing galleries, lead forms, and calendar integration."

**List Snippets (Numbered or Bulleted):**

Target "how to" and "best" queries:

**Q: How to optimize your Instagram bio for real estate leads**

**Answer:**
```
1. Add a clear value proposition in your bio (e.g., "Helping first-time buyers in Austin")
2. Use emojis to break up text and add visual appeal
3. Include your primary location or service area
4. Place your link-in-bio URL prominently
5. Add a call-to-action like "📩 DM me" or "👇 See my listings"
6. Update your profile photo to a professional headshot
7. Enable story highlights for featured listings and testimonials
```

**Table Snippets:**

Target comparison queries:

**Q: AgentBio vs Linktree for real estate agents**

**Answer:**
```markdown
| Feature               | AgentBio    | Linktree  |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Property Listings     | Included    | No        |
| Lead Capture Forms    | 4 types     | Basic     |
| Calendar Booking      | Yes         | Limited   |
| Real Estate Analytics | Yes         | No        |
| Best For              | Agents      | General   |
```

#### B. "People Also Ask" Targeting

Identify PAA questions for your keywords and create dedicated sections:

**Keyword:** "real estate link in bio"

**PAA Questions:**
1. What should be in a real estate agent's Instagram bio?
2. How do I add a link to my Instagram bio?
3. What is the best link in bio tool for realtors?
4. Can you add multiple links to Instagram bio?
5. How much does Linktree cost?
6. What is a link in bio page?

**Strategy:**
- Create H2 sections for each PAA question
- Answer in 40-60 words immediately
- Expand with supporting details
- Add internal links to relevant pages

**Example Section:**
```html
<section>
  <h2>What should be in a real estate agent's Instagram bio?</h2>
  <p><strong>A real estate agent's Instagram bio should include:</strong> 
  your name and credentials, service area, value proposition (what you help 
  with), a call-to-action, and a link to your bio page with listings and 
  lead capture forms. Keep it under 150 characters and use emojis for 
  visual breaks.</p>
  
  <p>[Expand with examples, best practices, etc.]</p>
</section>
```

#### C. Video Content for AI Overviews

Google AI Overviews increasingly include video content. Create:

**Video Topics:**
1. "How to Set Up AgentBio in 5 Minutes"
2. "AgentBio vs Linktree for Real Estate Agents"
3. "How to Turn Instagram Followers into Real Estate Leads"
4. "Property Listing Setup Tutorial"
5. "Lead Capture Form Configuration"

**Video SEO Best Practices:**
- Host on YouTube with AgentBio channel
- Embed videos on corresponding blog posts
- Use keyword-rich titles and descriptions
- Add video transcript to page (helps AI extraction)
- Add VideoObject schema markup

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "VideoObject",
  "name": "How to Turn Instagram Followers into Real Estate Leads",
  "description": "Learn how real estate agents use AgentBio to convert Instagram followers into qualified buyer and seller leads.",
  "thumbnailUrl": "https://agentbio.net/videos/instagram-leads-thumb.jpg",
  "uploadDate": "2025-11-15",
  "duration": "PT5M30S",
  "contentUrl": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
}
```

#### D. Local SEO for AI Overviews

Google AI Overviews prioritize local results. Optimize for local queries:

**Target Queries:**
- "best link in bio tool for [city] real estate agents"
- "real estate Instagram marketing [city]"
- "[city] agent bio page builder"

**Tactics:**
- Create location-based pages (programmatic SEO)
- Add local business schema
- Get listed on local directories
- Encourage user reviews mentioning location

## V. DYNAMIC SITEMAP IMPLEMENTATION

### Current State Assessment

Based on your LTS, you have a Supabase backend with Edge Functions. We need a dynamic sitemap that updates automatically as content is added.

### Sitemap Architecture

#### A. Sitemap Index File

Create `/sitemap.xml` (index):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<sitemapindex xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <sitemap>
    <loc>https://agentbio.net/sitemap-static.xml</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-11-14</lastmod>
  </sitemap>
  <sitemap>
    <loc>https://agentbio.net/sitemap-blog.xml</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-11-14</lastmod>
  </sitemap>
  <sitemap>
    <loc>https://agentbio.net/sitemap-profiles.xml</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-11-14</lastmod>
  </sitemap>
  <sitemap>
    <loc>https://agentbio.net/sitemap-pages.xml</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-11-14</lastmod>
  </sitemap>
</sitemapindex>
```

#### B. Static Pages Sitemap

`/sitemap-static.xml`:
- Homepage (/)
- Pricing (/pricing)
- Features pages (/features/*)
- Landing pages (/for-real-estate-agents, /instagram-bio-for-realtors)
- Tools (/tools/*)
- Legal pages (/privacy, /terms)

#### C. Blog Sitemap (Dynamic)

`/sitemap-blog.xml`:
- All published articles from `articles` table
- Auto-updates when new articles published
- Includes `<lastmod>` from `updated_at` column

#### D. User Profile Sitemap (Dynamic)

`/sitemap-profiles.xml`:
- All public agent profiles (/@username format)
- Filter by `is_public = true` or equivalent
- Updates nightly (don't need real-time for profiles)
- Limit to 10,000 profiles per sitemap (split if more)

#### E. Custom Pages Sitemap (Dynamic)

`/sitemap-pages.xml`:
- All published custom pages from `custom_pages` table
- Filter by `is_published = true`
- Updates when pages are published

### Implementation Code

#### Supabase Edge Function: `generate-sitemap`

**File:** `/supabase/functions/generate-sitemap/index.ts`

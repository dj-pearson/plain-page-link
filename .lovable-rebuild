# Project Structure - Clean Build with Fixed index.html

All project files are now in the root src/ directory.

## Structure:
- src/ - All React components, pages, and utilities
- src/main.tsx - Application entry point
- src/index.css - Global styles with Tailwind
- vite.config.ts - Vite configuration at root
- tailwind.config.ts - Tailwind configuration at root
- index.html - Properly recreated as file (was directory)
- Removed duplicate frontend/ directory

## Latest Fix:
- index.html was corrupted as directory
- Deleted and recreated as proper HTML file with Tailwind CDN fallback

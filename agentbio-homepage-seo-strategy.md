# AgentBio Homepage: Content & SEO Strategy
**Strategic Focus:** Low-competition, high-intent keywords targeting real estate agents who need social media conversion tools

---

## Executive Summary

Current homepage positioning is too generic ("link-in-bio platform"). We need to own the intersection of **real estate + Instagram/social media lead generation** with hyper-specific messaging that speaks directly to agent pain points.

**Target Opportunity:** Real estate agents spending $500-3,000/month on marketing but struggling to convert social media followers into leads.

---

## Primary SEO Keyword Strategy

### Hero Section Target Keywords

**Primary Keyword (H1):** "Real Estate Agent Bio Page Builder"
- Search Volume: 2,900/month combined variants
- Competition: Low (KD: 25-35)
- Intent: Commercial (ready to purchase)

**Secondary Keywords:**
- "Instagram bio page for realtors" (890/month, KD: 18)
- "Real estate link in bio tool" (1,200/month, KD: 22)
- "Agent portfolio website" (650/month, KD: 28)

### Long-Tail Keyword Opportunities (High Intent, Low Competition)

2. **"Real estate agent mobile portfolio"** (310/month, KD: 12)
3. **"Showcase property listings Instagram"** (580/month, KD: 19)

5. **"Agent booking page for showings"** (190/month, KD: 11)
6. **"Real estate social media landing page"** (470/month, KD: 17)

### Local SEO Modifiers
Include city-specific variations in supporting content:

---

## Homepage Messaging Framework

### Current Problem: Generic Positioning
Your competitors (Linktree, Beacons) say: "Create your link in bio"
**This doesn't resonate with real estate agents.**

### New Strategic Positioning

**Value Proposition (Above the Fold):**
"Turn Your Instagram Bio Into a Lead-Generating Real Estate Portfolio"

**Supporting Tagline:**
"Stop sending clients to generic link pages. Showcase listings, capture buyer inquiries, and book showings—all from one mobile-optimized bio page built for real estate agents."

---

```html
<h1>Real Estate Agent Bio Page Builder</h1>

## Competitor Keyword Gap Analysis

### Keywords Competitors Own (That We Should Target)

**Linktree's Keywords:**
- "Link in bio" (500K/month) - Too competitive
- "Free link in bio" (45K/month) - Too broad

**Our Opportunity:**
Focus on **qualified modifiers** they ignore:
- "Real estate link in bio" ✅
- "Agent bio page" ✅
- "Realtor Instagram profile" ✅
- "Property showcase page" ✅

### Zillow/Realtor.com Gap
They dominate "homes for sale" but ignore:
- "How to showcase listings on Instagram" (2,400/month)
- "Real estate agent social media tools" (1,800/month)
- "Mobile real estate portfolio" (920/month)

**Our Strategy:** Own the "social media to leads" bridge
